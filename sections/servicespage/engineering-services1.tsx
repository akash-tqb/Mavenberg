              CAD data automation
            </h1>
            <p>
              We understand that tThe biggest problem with a system changeover
              is accurate and verified data migration and conversion, which can,
              in the worst case, lead to the loss of vital information.
            </p>
            <p>
              What makes our service special is the migration that runs parallel
              to productive operation and integrated and automated verification,
              so that no operational downtime is required â€“ unlike with other
              migration approaches. As a result, we can migrate data from
              thousands of CAD documents from project start to full production
              operation, quickly, and with zero downtime and risks.
